Currently a PhD student at the University of Surrey's CS department, working at the intersection of (meta-)RL & Compositional Generalisation. Also interested in AI for Science and Causality.

Always looking for collaborators and new exciting projects in this space, so feel free to [reach out](mailto:me@evangelos.ai)!
